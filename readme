#Image Classification with Neural Network (MNIST)

##description
 This is a Python project that demonstrates how to perform image classification on the MNIST dataset using a pre-trained neural network model. This project allows users to input image files and obtain predictions for the digits represented in those images. It includes functionality for preprocessing images, loading a pre-trained model, and performing inference. This project serves as a simple example of how to use pre-trained models for image classification tasks.

 ##Requirements
  *Python 3.x
  *PyTorch
  *torchvision
  *PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Usage
  1.unzip The code
  2.Navigate to the project directory
  3.run "python classifier.py" on terminal
  4.run "python userInteraction.py" on terminal

## Files
###Classifier.py
 - This is the python Scripy
 - It is responsible for creating the model
 - It also train the model and save it

###UserInteraction.py
 - It allow user to use the pre trained model
 - It prompt user for image path and predict it's label

###gitRepo
 -contains all my commits
###log.txt
 - This is a file that contains the output of the last time I ran the model
 - It shows the training loss of the model after each epoch
 - It also has the accuracy after each step and epoch

 ## Code structure
 1."classifier.py" which is the main script
 2."userInteraction.py" - utility script
 3."my_Model.pkl" - Model
